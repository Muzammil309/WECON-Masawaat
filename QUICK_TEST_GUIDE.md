# Quick Test Guide - Production Login

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED - Ready to Test!

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**Root Cause:** The `em_profiles` table was completely empty. All users existed in `auth.users` but had no profiles, causing login to fail silently.

**Solution:** 
1. Created profiles for all 5 existing users
2. Installed automatic profile creation trigger for future signups

### Attendee Accounts (→ `/dashboard`)
- **Email:** `alizeh995@gmail.com` (most recent login)
- **Email:** `alisam991@wecon.events`

## 🔧 Diagnostic Endpoints

### Check Environment Variables
```

  }
}
```

## 🐛 If Login Still Fails

### Collect This Information:

1. **Which email did you use?**
   - This helps verify the profile exists

2. **Browser console logs**
   - F12 → Console → Copy all logs from login attempt

3. **Network tab details**
   - F12 → Network → Filter by "Fetch/XHR"
   - Check status codes for:
     - POST `/auth/v1/token`
     - POST `/auth/callback`
     - GET `/admin` or `/dashboard`

4. **Exact behavior**
   - Does it show "Signing in..." forever?
   - Do you see any error messages?
   - Does it redirect but then bounce back to login?
