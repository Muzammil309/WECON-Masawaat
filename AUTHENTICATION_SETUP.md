# Authentication Setup & Admin Account

## ‚úÖ Email Confirmation Disabled

**Status**: Email confirmation has been successfully disabled in Supabase.

### What Was Changed:

1. **Supabase Auth Configuration Updated**:
   - `mailer_autoconfirm` set to `true`
   - `site_url` updated to `https://wecon-masawaaat.vercel.app`
   
2. **User Experience Improved**:
   - Users can now sign up and log in immediately without email verification
   - No more "Check your email for confirmation link" messages
   - Signup success message updated to: "Account created successfully! You can now sign in."
   - Auto-switches to sign-in tab after successful signup

### How It Works Now:

**Before** (with email confirmation):
```
User signs up ‚Üí Email sent ‚Üí User clicks link ‚Üí Account confirmed ‚Üí User can log in
```

**After** (without email confirmation):
```
User signs up ‚Üí Account automatically confirmed ‚Üí User can log in immediately
```

## üîë Admin Account Credentials

An existing user account has been configured as an admin account.

### Admin Login Credentials:

```
Email: admin@changemechanics.pk
Password: [Use the password you set when creating this account]
```

**Note**: If you don't remember the password, you can:
1. Go to the login page
2. Click "Forgot Password" (if implemented)
3. Or create a new admin account using the signup form and I'll update it to admin role

### Admin Account Details:

- **User ID**: `12ffd52d-a445-4bca-8c27-20355cac9370`
- **Role**: `admin`
- **Full Name**: Admin User
- **Email Confirmed**: ‚úÖ Yes (manually confirmed)
- **Created**: 2025-09-29

### Admin Dashboard Access:

Once logged in with the admin account:
- You will be automatically redirected to `/admin`
- The navigation will show "Admin" button instead of "Dashboard"
- You'll have access to all admin features

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating Additional Admin Accounts

If you need to create more admin accounts, you have two options:

### Option 1: Create via Signup Form (Recommended)

1. Go to signup page and create a new account
2. Note the email address you used
3. Run this SQL query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Replace 'newemail@example.com' with the actual email
UPDATE em_profiles 
SET role = 'admin', full_name = 'Admin Name'
WHERE id = (
  SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'newemail@example.com'
);
```

### Option 2: Manual Database Entry

If you need to create an admin account programmatically, contact me and I can run the necessary SQL commands.

## üìã User Roles

The system supports the following roles in `em_profiles.role`:

- **`attendee`** (default): Regular event attendees
  - Access to `/dashboard`
  - Can view tickets, schedule, and networking features
  
- **`speaker`**: Event speakers
  - Access to `/dashboard` (speaker dashboard)
  - Can manage their sessions and presentations
  
- **`admin`**: System administrators
  - Access to `/admin`
  - Full access to all features
  - Can manage events, users, tickets, etc.

## üîí Security Notes

### Important Security Considerations:

1. **Email Confirmation Disabled**:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Users can sign up with any email address without verification
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider re-enabling email confirmation for production if email verification is important
   - ‚úÖ Good for development and testing

2. **Password Requirements**:
   - Minimum length: 6 characters
   - No special character requirements currently
   - Consider strengthening password requirements for production

3. **Admin Role Assignment**:
   - Admin role must be manually assigned via database
   - Users cannot self-assign admin role through the UI
   - This is a security feature to prevent unauthorized admin access

### Re-enabling Email Confirmation (If Needed):

If you want to re-enable email confirmation in the future:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Settings
2. Set "Enable email confirmations" to ON
3. Or use the API:

```bash
PATCH /v1/projects/umywdcihtqfullbostxo/config/auth
{
  "mailer_autoconfirm": false
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid login credentials"

**Solution**: 
- Verify you're using the correct email and password
- Check if the account exists in `auth.users` table
- Verify `email_confirmed_at` is not null

### Issue: Admin account redirects to `/dashboard` instead of `/admin`

**Solution**:
- Check the role in `em_profiles` table:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, full_name, role FROM em_profiles 
  WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'admin@changemechanics.pk');
  ```
- If role is not 'admin', update it:
  ```sql
  UPDATE em_profiles SET role = 'admin' 
  WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'admin@changemechanics.pk');
  ```

### Issue: "User already registered"

**Solution**:
- This email is already in use
- Try logging in instead of signing up
- Or use a different email address

### Issue: Cannot access admin dashboard

**Possible causes**:
1. Role is not set to 'admin' in em_profiles
2. User is not logged in
3. Session expired - try logging out and back in
